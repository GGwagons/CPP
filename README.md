<h1>C++ Projects Overview</h1>
<p>This page provides a detailed overview of the C++ projects from modules 00 to 09 at 42 School. These projects progressively build a deep understanding of the C++ programming language and advanced programming concepts.</p>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 00 – Basics of Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>Introduced to C++ syntax, including variables, data types, conditional statements, and loops. This module focused on creating simple classes and methods, laying the groundwork for object-oriented programming (OOP).</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 01 – Memory Management and Pointers</h2>
    <p>Dived into memory management in C++ by learning about pointers, references, and dynamic memory allocation. Key skills include resource management using <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, and understanding how data is stored and accessed in memory.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 02 – Canonical Form and Operator Overloading</h2>
    <p>Learned to implement classes in their canonical form, including constructors, destructors, copy constructors, and assignment operators. Also mastered operator overloading to extend class functionality.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 03 – Inheritance and Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Explored advanced OOP concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism, to create modular and extensible code. Implemented virtual functions and abstract classes to enable dynamic binding.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 04 – Abstractions, Interfaces, and Exception Handling</h2>
    <p>Focused on creating abstract classes and polymorphic interfaces while mastering error handling using exceptions (<code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>). Learned how to design robust and safe programs.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 05 – Rich Type System and Templates</h2>
    <p>Introduced to the concept of templates to create generic classes and functions. Explored the benefits of type abstraction and code reuse in C++ using template metaprogramming.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 06 – C++ STL (Standard Template Library)</h2>
    <p>Gained proficiency in the use of the STL, including containers like vectors, maps, and sets, as well as algorithms and iterators. Applied STL to solve complex programming challenges efficiently.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 07 – Advanced Template Programming</h2>
    <p>Dived deeper into advanced template programming techniques, including template specialization and variadic templates. Learned to build highly customizable and efficient code solutions.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 08 – Interfacing with Legacy Code</h2>
    <p>Explored techniques to integrate modern C++ code with legacy C codebases. Covered topics like extern "C", and worked on real-world scenarios requiring compatibility between languages.</p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <h2>Module 09 – Multithreading and Concurrency</h2>
    <p>Studied multithreading using C++'s threading library. Implemented thread synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, locks, and condition variables to create safe and efficient concurrent applications.</p>
